# README Node JS
  
  ## Description
  This challenge is to be able to write a README file in the VS Code instead of Github. 
  
  ## Table of Contents 
 
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#credits)
  - [License](#license)
  - [Link](#link) 
  - [How_to_Contribute](#how_to_contribute)
  
  ## Installation
  Connect the 2 JS files through require, which also needs the inquirer, fs and path. Then develop a series of questions for what to put on the README file, then write and synch to file (structure and asynchronous data becomes synchornized respectively). Then call the init() function to prompt the questions being asked, which are stored inside inquirer responses, the finally generating the file, followed by the strings of answers through generateMarkdown page. On this page, it renders the license and badge, as well as the github link, then prints these to specific areas of the template,.
  
  ## Usage
  The information will all be stringified, so it's converted through function generateMarkdown, taking the inputs as data, which is returned into the function createreadME, where the template including template literals are to place it onto the printed readME. Each piece of information being rendered by assigning from data, i.e. questions, .name, or the function on the page.
